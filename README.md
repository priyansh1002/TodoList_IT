# Todo List App
## This is a simple todo list application built with _React and Vite_, utilizing _Context API_ for state management and _local storage_ for persisting data. With this app, users can easily add, edit, and delete tasks.

## Features
* Add Tasks: Add new tasks to the todo list.
* Edit Tasks: Easily edit existing tasks inline.
* Delete Tasks: Remove tasks from the list.
* Local Storage: Data is stored locally, allowing users to persist their todo list across sessions.

## Technologies Used
* React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* Vite: A fast, opinionated web dev build tool that serves your code via native ES Module imports during development.
* Context API: A React feature that allows state to be shared across the component tree without having to pass props manually.
* Local Storage API: A Web Storage API for storing data in a web browser.



# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
